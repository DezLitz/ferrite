# Environment Variables

This document describes the environment variables used by `<app>`.

The application may consume other undocumented environment variables; this
document only shows those variables defined using [Ferrite].

## Index

- [`LOG_LEVEL`](#LOG_LEVEL) â€” the minimum log level to record

## Specification

### `LOG_LEVEL`

> the minimum log level to record

This variable **MUST** be set to one of the values below.
If it is undefined or empty the application will print usage information to
`STDERR` then exit with a non-zero exit code.

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug # show information for developers
export LOG_LEVEL=info  # standard log messages
export LOG_LEVEL=warn  # important, but don't need individual human review
export LOG_LEVEL=error # a healthy application shouldn't produce any errors
export LOG_LEVEL=fatal # the application cannot proceed
```
